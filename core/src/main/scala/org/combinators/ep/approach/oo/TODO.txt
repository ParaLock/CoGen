1. Make visitor with side effects and see how to share it (perhaps even using Strategy DP) -- DONE!!!!
2. Tackle Trivially! implementation -- DONE!!!
3. Interpreter -- almost done! Need to have static import (which is Java-ability and not OO or anyParadigm) for test cases
  Also need to fix 'instantiate' to call factory method that is statically imported.
4. Algebra (aka Modularity for the Masses)
  This will need Lambda Function capabilities

in parallel Jan:
1. Start thinking about Haskell
