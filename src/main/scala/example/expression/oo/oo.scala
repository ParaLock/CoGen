/**
  * This package contains the strawman object-oriented solution to the Expression Problem in Java.
  *
  * Technically, this is not a valid solution, since one must change existing classes when new
  * operations are defined. Still, it is provided here to demonstrate the mechanics of generating
  * code solutions for EP.
