Future Work:

Consider adding to LanguageIndependentGenerator

  /**
    * Modify compilation unit as needed for extra language-specific mechanisms for allowing generated
    * language to be compiled/interpreted.
    *
    * TBA: Better to have dispatch return Expression *and* obligations for context such as #include or imports
    * TODO: Kick down the road
    *
    * a) hard-code fully-qualified class names
    * b) collect together all compilation units
    * c) other options...
